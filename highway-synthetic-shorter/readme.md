## Highway Traffic (Unidirectional, Shorter)

This simulation is created by shortening the length in one-way highway traffic scenario in order to decrease simulation time and load. Check [highway-synthetic](https://github.com/kctnky/sumo-traffic/tree/master/highway-synthetic) for more details.

### Summary

* Total 4 kilometers in length
* Uni-directional, 3 lanes
* Speed limit is 130 km/h
* There are 4 different kinds of vehicles: Normal Car, Fast Car, Overland Bus, Truck
* Vehicle generation can be approximated as Poisson distribution whose mean changes with respect to hour of the day
