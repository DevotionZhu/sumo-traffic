## Highway Traffic (Bidirectional)

This simulation is created by adding traffic in reverse direction to the one-way highway traffic scenario. The road network, traffic demands and all configurable settings are exactly same for each direction. Check [highway-synthetic](https://github.com/kctnky/sumo-traffic/tree/master/highway-synthetic) for more details.

### Summary

* Total 36.1 kilometers in length
* Bi-directional, 3 lanes in each direction
* Speed limit is 130 km/h
* There are 4 different kinds of vehicles: Normal Car, Fast Car, Overland Bus, Truck
* Vehicle generation can be approximated as Poisson distribution whose mean changes with respect to hour of the day
